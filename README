Regexlint
---------

Regexlint will examine all regular expressions in an importable Pygments
lexer, and report things that are probably not doing what you think they're
doing.  For example, patterns like:

    (elseif|else)

It can also warn about a few syntax problems, for example

    (r'(foo)\s+(bar)', bygroups(Blah)),


Todo
----

* Parse verbose regular expressions
* Fix bygroups-checking to catch more errors (like ``\s`` above outside
  capturing)
* Fix alternation-inversion-checking to understand anchors
* Add lots of checks for character classes
